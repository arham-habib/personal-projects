    "> Let's say there are 100 prisoners. A warden assigns them a number, 1 to 100, and repeats are allowed. A prisoner will be called in one by one, and shown the sum of every prisoner's numbers minus their own. They can guess their number. If a single person correctly guesses their number, they are all free. What is an algorithm to guarantee this? They cannot communicate once they start seeing thier numbers."
