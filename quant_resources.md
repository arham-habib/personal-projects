# Resources for Quant Trading/Research

- Last Updated: 2025.01.04

These are resources I have found interesting or helpful in my (currently short) career in finance. This is also my reading list – if I haven't explicitly read/vetted the resource linked, I'll flag it in the description.

For the moment, these are ordered arbitrarily and uncategorized.

## Blogs: 

### [Moontower](https://blog.moontower.ai/)

- Run by a former option trader at SIG who covered oil – one of the most comprehensive blogs for trading options, and great for general trading intuition.

### [Gregory Gundersen](https://gregorygundersen.com/)

- Run by a QR at the Xantium Group. Covers a lot of the math behind options, portfolio construction, and machine learning techniques. 

### [Reasonable Deviations](https://reasonabledeviations.com/)

- Run by Robert Martin, currently a trader at D.E. Shaw. Some interesting pieces on markets/trading, and many interesting thoughts on his second brain system. 

### [This Blog is Systematic](https://qoppac.blogspot.com/p/about-me.html)

- Run by Robert Carver, who used to work on systemtic macro (AHL) at the MAN Group. A very principled, first-principles approach to systematic trading. 

### [QuantyMacro](https://www.quantymacro.com/)

- Run by a trader at a systematic macro fund in the UK. His articles are generally interesting and nuanced, though not the most big-picture. 

### [MacroSynergy](https://macrosynergy.com/)

- The articles here are mostly published by a former quant at Graham Capital / UBS AG / Bluecrest. Similar to Rob Carver's blog, I think the approach is very principled, intuitive, and didactic. 

### [Clouded Judgment](https://cloudedjudgement.substack.com/)

- Run by Jamin Ball, a partner at Altimeter Capital. I don't think this is very quantitative, but his reasoning is systematic and clear. More importantly, I think these hedge funds tilted long market, long tech, long momentum have become more popular and are now the marginal buyers and sellers in tech, and by extension, much of the S&P 500 / NASDAQ 100 incides. It's helpful and interesting to learn how they view the world. 

### [The Diff](https://www.thediff.co/)

- Run by Byrne Hobert, a former PM at SAC Capital (now Point 72). He writes interesting and insightful articles focused on general finance and technology. Though broad, I find them helpful for building intuition about the industry. 

### [Matt Levine](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine)

- Arguably the most prolific finance writer of late – following this is table stakes for communicating with people that work in finance. 

### [Paul Krugman](https://paulkrugman.substack.com/)

- Run by a Nobel Laureate economist and professor. I think this is a particuarly approachable take on economics – his models are simple and interpretable, and he dedicates a lot of time to building intuition. 

### [Dampened Spring](https://dampedspring.com/)

- Run by a former Bridgewater employee. Good fundamental macro research.

### [Campbell Ramble](https://www.campbellramble.ai/)

- Run by a former Bridegater employee. Entertaining, big-picture analysis of commodities and other aspects of macro.

### [Citrini](https://www.citriniresearch.com/)

- Thematic macro research. I do not purchase this, but many coworkers find it insightful. 

## Books: 

### [Elements of Quantitative Investing](to be released) - Giuseppe A. Paleologo

- Have not read cover-to-cover, but have consulted the drafts for specific solutions to problems I run into. Rigorous and well-presented. 

### [Advanced Portfolio Management: A Quant's Guide for Fundamental Investors](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Portfolio-Management-Quantitative-Fundamental/dp/1119789052) - Giuseppe A. Paleologo

- Written by the former head of risk / QR at Millenium, Citadel, and HRT. Currently heads QR at Balyasny. A great introduction to quantitative portfolio management for beginners or those with a fundamental long-short background.

### [The World for Sale: Money, Power, and the Traders Who Barter the Earth's Resources](https://www.amazon.com/World-Sale-Traders-Barter-Resources/dp/0190070080) - Javier Blas & Jack Farchy

- A good introduction to commodities and the massive, under-discussed trading houses that control their flow (Glencore, Vitol, Cargill, Javelin, etc.).

### [Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk](https://www.amazon.com/Against-Gods-Remarkable-Story-Risk/dp/0471295639) - Peter L. Bernstein

- Have not read, but have heard fantastic things.

### [Incerto Series](https://www.amazon.com/Incerto-Deluxe-Randomness-Procrustes-Antifragile/dp/198481981X) - Nassim Nicholas Taleb

- Read and enjoyed *Fooled by Randomness*. The prose is light, and the lessons are insightful, though they have become more widely accepted now than they were when he introduced them. 

### [The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Solved-Market-Revolution/dp/073521798X) - Gregory Zuckerman

- I found this interesting, though it has nothing on Rentech's strategies. It extensively covers how Simons hired people, which is also insightful and hints at Medallion's approach.

### [A Man for All Markets: From Las Vegas to Wall Street, How I Beat the Dealer and the Market](https://www.amazon.com/Man-All-Markets-Street-Dealer/dp/0812979907) - Edward O. Thorp

- Thorp is probably my favorite hedge fund manager. The book is witty, the stories are clever, and there is a good amount of philosophy on what creates a successful quantitative strategy. The latter half of the book is dedicated to advice for the everyday household portfolio manager or risk taker, which was useful. Many of his inisghts are so beautiful because he spent a lot of time rigorously proving them, but the final product is incredibly simple.

### [Liar's Poker](https://www.amazon.com/Liars-Poker-Norton-Paperback-Michael/dp/039333869X) - Michael Lewis

- Have not read, have heard good things

### [The Ten Equations that Rule the World: And How You Can Use Them Too](https://www.amazon.com/Ten-Equations-that-Rule-World/dp/024142383X) - David Sumpter

- Have not read, was recommended by Kris from Moontower

### [More Money Than God: Hedge Funds and the Making of a New Elite](https://www.amazon.com/More-Money-Than-God-Making/dp/0143119419) - Sebastian Mallaby

- More of a history than anything else, but interesting and well-written. A close friend got me this for my 19th birthday, and it's a large reason I wanted to enter trading instead of the conventional IB/PE pipeline from Penn.

### [Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Bets-Making-Smarter-Decisions/dp/0735216355) - Annie Duke

- Written by a former WSOP bracelet holder, covers a robust framework for making decisions when playing games of incomplete information.

### [The Alchemy of Finance](https://www.amazon.com/Alchemy-Finance-George-Soros/dp/0471445495) - George Soros

- This book was a mixed bag. I'm not a fan of the philosophy interspersed throughout, largely inspired by Popper, but Soros' opinions about the market are unique and insightful.

### [The Theory of Poker](https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Poker-Professional-Player-Teaches/dp/1880685000) - David Sklansky

- A book on poker that generalizes well to adversarial environments (like markets). Was curriculum at CitSec.

### [Systematic Trading: A unique new method for designing trading and investing systems](https://www.amazon.com/Systematic-Trading-designing-trading-investing/dp/0857194453) - Robert Carver

- Written by Robert Carver, who used to work on systemtic macro (AHL) at the MAN Group.Have not read, but I've heard that this is the closest to a how-to book for systematic futures trading that there is. I really enjoy his blog (linked above).

### [Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives](https://www.amazon.com/Options-Futures-Other-Derivatives-9th/dp/0133456315) - John C. Hull

- Have not read, but is one of the dominant textbooks for options.

### [Option Volatility and Pricing Strategies](https://www.amazon.com/Option-Volatility-Pricing-Strategies-Techniques/dp/155738486X) - Sheldon Natenberg

- Was curriculum at CitSec (and Optiver, unsure about others). A table-stakes book to read if trading options.

### [The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power](https://www.amazon.com/Prize-Epic-Quest-Money-Power/dp/1439110123) - Daniel Yergin

- An incredibly dense summary of the history of oil. Insightful, but slow-paced and only partially relevant to trading.

### [Expected Returns: An Investor's Guide to Harvesting Market Rewards](https://www.amazon.com/Expected-Returns-Investors-Harvesting-Rewards/dp/1119990726) - Antti Ilmanen

- Have not read, but was highly recommended by my head of desk. 

### [Big Debt Crises](https://www.amazon.com/Big-Debt-Crises-Ray-Dalio/dp/057856565X) - Ray Dalio

- Dalio does an incredible job presenting why debt crises happen and the levers that governments have to respond with. I think this is far superior to economic theory because it is informed by empirical observations.

### [When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management](https://www.amazon.com/When-Genius-Failed-Long-Term-Management/dp/0375758259) - Roger Lowenstein

- A detailed breakdown of an infamous story in finance. I think Lowenstein does a good job presenting what worked and what didn't work for LTCM.

### [Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction](https://www.amazon.com/Superforecasting-Science-Prediction-Philip-Tetlock/dp/0804136718) - Philip E. Tetlock

- I think this is a must-read. Though it mostly presents a framework for evaluating the probability of events and assessing forecast accuracy, I think these skills generalize well to finance, and particularly fundamental macro.

### [Merchants of Grain](https://www.amazon.com/Merchants-Grain-Power-Profits-Companies/dp/1504049135) - Dan Morgan

- Have not read, have heard good things

### [The Bond King: How One Man Made a Market, Built an Empire, and Lost It All](https://www.amazon.com/Bond-King-Market-Built-Empire/dp/1250120845) - Mary Childs

- Have not read, have heard good things


### [Trading at the Speed of Light: How Ultrafast Algorithms Are Transforming Financial Markets](https://www.amazon.com/Trading-Speed-Light-Algorithms-Transforming/dp/0691211388) - Donald MacKenzie

- Have not read, have heard good things

### [The Price of Peace: Money, Democracy, and the Life of John Maynard Keynes](https://www.amazon.com/Price-Peace-Democracy-Maynard-Keynes/dp/0525509038) - Zachary D. Carter

- Have not read, have heard good things

### [The Devil Take the Hindmost: A History of Financial Speculation](https://www.amazon.com/Devil-Take-Hindmost-Financial-Speculation/dp/0452281806) - Edward Chancellor

- Have not read, have heard good things

### [The Accidental Theorist: And Other Dispatches from the Dismal Science](https://www.amazon.com/Accidental-Theorist-Other-Dispatches-Dismal/dp/0393318877) - Paul Krugman

- A collection of short essays by Krugman (whose blog I linked above) – remarkable for their simplicity and insight. Unlike many theorists, Krugman uses the world to inform his models, not the other way around. 

### [High Frequency Trading: A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems](https://www.amazon.com/High-Frequency-Trading-Practical-Algorithmic-Strategies/dp/1118343506) - Irene Aldridge

- Have not read, but is highly recommended online (which I'd take with a grain of salt).

### [Inside the Black Box: A Simple Guide to Quantitative and High Frequency Trading](https://www.amazon.com/Inside-Black-Box-Quantitative-Trading/dp/1118362411) - Rishi K. Narang

- Have not read, but is highly recommended online (which I'd take with a grain of salt).

### [The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Statistical-Learning-Prediction-Statistics/dp/0387848576) - Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman

- My first place to go when I struggle with techniques in classical ML. I think almost every QR I know has read and understood this.

### [Linear Algebra and Learning from Data](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Learning-Gilbert-Strang/dp/0692196382) - Gilbert Strang

- I skimmed through a few of Strang's books and found this to be the most quick-and-dirty to apply to quant research. His talent is building beautiful intuition.


## Papers: [#TODO]

## Misc:

- [Market Impact and Execution Strategies](https://x.com/imotw2/status/1860802661832155549)

    - A discussion of the factors driving market impact, beyond standard models and based on microstructure.

- [Ahead of the Yield Curve](https://pivotal.substack.com/p/ahead-of-the-yield-curve)

    - A reflection on building a high-frequency yield curve trading system for US Treasuries in the early 2000s. Surprisingly forthcoming and detailed, though the system is now dated.

- [How much do you believe your results?](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nnDTgmzRrzDMiPF9B/how-much-do-you-believe-your-results)

    - A discussion of Goodhart's Law. This is particualy important for those researching low-frequency strategies, where data is scarce by nature.

- [Matrix Factorization Techniques for Recommender Systems](https://datajobs.com/data-science-repo/Recommender-Systems-%5BNetflix%5D.pdf)

    - Unrelated to trading, but such an incredible application of simple linear algebra for a very powerful algorithm

## Repositories: 

### [toraniko (an open-source factor model)](https://github.com/0xfdf/toraniko)

- An intuitive, performant implementation of a factor model as described in *Advanced Portfolio Management*

### [PyPortfolioOpt](https://github.com/robertmartin8/PyPortfolioOpt/tree/master/pypfopt)

- A didactic implementation of the Black Litterman model. For real applications, I'd recommend building this yourself with cvxpy, but there aren't many good open-source implementations of an optimizer and this gets the job done.

### [hummingbot](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot)

- I'm just starting to look through this for personal use, but it seems like there are some valuable lessons in how to interact with REST endpoints or websockets in a performant way.

# Fun, but unhelpful: 

I don't recommend these for investing content, though they are interesting

## Books: 

### [Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Boys-Wall-Street-Revolt/dp/0393351599) - Michael Lewis

- I enjoyed this when I read it, but it's an oversimplification and is pretty dated at this point. I think the opinions on dark pools are particularly one-sided. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGPQME_EKVM) video from Kris (Moontower) has a good argument for why the idea of dark pools existing to pick off investors is incomplete.

### [Black Edge: Inside Information, Dirty Money, and the Quest to Bring Down the Most Wanted Man on Wall Street](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Edge-Inside-Information-Wanted/dp/0812995805) - Sheelah Kolhatkar

- I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it for a rainy weekend, but the focus is on fraud and insider trading, not finance.
